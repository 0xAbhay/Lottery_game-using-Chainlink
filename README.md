# Lottery Game

Welcome to the Lottery Game project! In this project, build a lottery game using smart contracts on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. The game allows players to participate by paying an entry fee, and once the maximum number of players is reached, a random winner will be chosen. The winner will receive a prize amount based on the number of maximum players and the entry fee.

## Contract Details

The smart contract for the Lottery Game has been deployed and verified on the Polygon Mumbai Testnet. You can find the contract at the following address:

Contract Address: `0xA1b93425E4457Ad41AfB4FD6A93b118b07f1b2F2`

## How the Game Works

1. Each game has a maximum number of players and an entry fee.
2. Players can participate in the game by paying the specified entry fee.
3. Once the maximum number of players has been reached, the game will automatically choose a random winner.
4. The winner will receive an amount of ether equal to `maxplayers * entryfee`.
